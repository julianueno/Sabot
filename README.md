# Sabot
Sabot is an app for delivery drivers conceived to subvert the information asymmetry between worker and algorithm. It has been designed in conversation with London delivery riders. A series of features improve the conditions on the road for drivers and repurpose data collection. Instead of data being used to individualise performance and feed the optimisation of the platform’s algorithm, sabot proposes to use data to build on workers’ leverage, to improve working conditions and driver’s capacity to organize.

## Features

While working, delivery riders normally see only an individual icon corresponding to their account. OnRoad is a map populated by all drivers using Sabot, bringing together workers of  multiple companies. It creates clusters of riders to indicate the area where they can be found but conceals the information on their exact location for their safety (against vehicle thefts or police controls).
OnRoad subverts the extractive surveillance logic of delivery apps, and proposes to create a digital commons for riders.

Being on the road is dangerous to precarious workers with unregular migration status. Often, authorities deploy check-points on the road asking for insurance and migration status. A map where drivers can update controls will help to keep be safe and organize to help other drivers in distress from immigration policies

With the same outline, a feature the app has a feature for reporting accidents. Currently there are no official numbers, although a relation between injuries and time requirements on delivery apps is suspected.
